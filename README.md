# Predicting Travel Patterns Using Flickr
Using the 100 Million Photos and Videos database from Flickr, how can we predict travel patterns in the United States and Central America?

##The Hypothesis:

People typically travel to take photographs, or go to a specific place to take photographs. Even if it is their backyard, it is a place that has meaning and visual attraction. I am interested in looking at photography as a predictor of ideal locations to travel to. Where do people like to take photographs? Where _will_ people like to take photographs?

*Where will people travel?*
